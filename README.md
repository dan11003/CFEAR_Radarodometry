# CFEAR Radarodometry

## CFEAR-3 journal: "Lidar-level localization with radar? The CFEAR approach to accurate, fast and robust large-scale radar odometry in diverse environments"
* Currently under review
* A demo is found [here](https://youtu.be/ENOksytHMHw). The video intends to visually demonstrate the experiments carried out in the paper.
* An ArXiv link will be posted within soon
* This repo will be updated with our sourcecode for CFEAR Radarodometry upon journal acceptance
