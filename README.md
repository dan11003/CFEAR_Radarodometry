## CFEAR-3 journal: "Lidar-level localization with radar? The CFEAR approach to accurate, fast and robust large-scale radar odometry in diverse environments"
* Currently under review
* A demo is found [here](https://youtu.be/QP_3Q-UChtU). The video intends to visually demonstrate the experiments carried out in the paper  <!--https://youtu.be/ENOksytHMHw-->
* We have now published our [diverse radar datasets](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uATfrAe-KHlz29e-Ul8qUbUKwPxBFIhP?usp=sharing)
* Our evaluation will be released soon
* An ArXiv link will be posted within soon
* This repo will be updated with our sourcecode for CFEAR Radarodometry upon journal acceptance
